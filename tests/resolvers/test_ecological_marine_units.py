def test_get_environments_for_geometry_z_values():
    """Test the get_environments_for_geometry method.

    When a geometry has a single z value (i.e. discrete depth) the
    get_environments_for_geometry_z_values method should return any EMUs
    intersecting with the z value, including both bounding EMUs when the z
    value equals the boundary between the 2 EMUs. When a geometry has 2 z
    values (i.e. range of depths) the method should return any EMUs
    intersecting with the range, including both bounding EMUs when the z value
    equals the boundary between the 2 EMUs. When a geometry has no z values
    (i.e. no depth) the method should return all EMUs.

    Rather than using a set of geographic coverage fixtures, each exemplifying
    the scenarios, we reduce the number of API calls to the EMU server by
    modifying the z values of the response objects geometry property.

    The results of the assertions were determined by visual inspection of the
    EMU server map service interface at the geographic coverage represented in
    the test fixture. Or rather the test fixture was set based on a specific
    data point in the EMU server map service interface.
