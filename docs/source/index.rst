`geoenvo` is a Python library that links geographic coordinates to environmental properties at a global scale. These properties are described using the terminology of the source data, with options to map to other semantic resources, including controlled vocabularies and ontologies. By default, `geoenvo` maps to ENVO (`Environment Ontology`_).

If you know of a data source, vocabulary, or ontology that could enhance this effort, please share it—even if it overlaps with existing resources.

Motivation
----------

There is a vast amount of data available from diverse sources, and geoenvo offers a straightforward way to expose the environmental semantics of these datasets. By doing so, it provides a mechanism to connect otherwise disparate data sources through a shared environmental context, unlocking new opportunities for integrated analysis and research.

Quick Start
-----------

Install the current release from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/clnsmth/geoenvo.git@main

Resolve a geometry to its environment(s).

.. code-block:: python

    from geoenvo.data_sources import WorldTerrestrialEcosystems
    from geoenvo.resolver import Resolver
    from geoenvo.geometry import Geometry

    # Create a geometry in GeoJSON format
    point_on_land = {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            -122.622364,
            37.905931
        ]
    }
    geometry = Geometry(point_on_land)

    # Configure the resolver with one or more data sources
    resolver = Resolver(data_source=[WorldTerrestrialEcosystems()])

    # Resolve the geometry to environmental descriptions
    response = resolver.resolve(
        geometry,
        identifier="5b4edec5-ea5e-471a-8a3c-2c1171d59dee",
        description="Point on land",
    )

The response is a GeoJSON Feature containing a list of environments and their associated properties. These properties map to semantic resources, ENVO by default.

              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }


Format the response as Schema.org.

.. code-block:: python

    schema_org = response.to_schema_org()
