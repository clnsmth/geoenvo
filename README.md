`geoenvo` is a Python library that links geographic coordinates to environmental properties at a global scale. These properties are described using the terminology of the source data, with options to map to other semantic resources, including controlled vocabularies and ontologies. By default, `geoenvo` maps to ENVO ([Environment Ontology](https://sites.google.com/site/environmentontology/)).

If you know of a **data source, vocabulary, or ontology** 
that could enhance this effort, please share it—even if it overlaps with existing resources.

## Motivation

There is a vast amount of data available from diverse sources, and geoenvo offers a straightforward way to expose the environmental semantics of these datasets. By doing so, it provides a mechanism to connect otherwise disparate data sources through a shared environmental context, unlocking new opportunities for integrated analysis and research.

## Quick Start

Install the current release from GitHub.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/clnsmth/geoenvo.git@main
```

Resolve a geometry to its environment(s).

```python
from geoenvo.data_sources import WorldTerrestrialEcosystems
from geoenvo.resolver import Resolver
from geoenvo.geometry import Geometry

# Create a geometry in GeoJSON format
point_on_land = {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
        -122.622364,
        37.905931
    ]
}
geometry = Geometry(point_on_land)

# Configure the resolver with one or more data sources
resolver = Resolver(data_source=[WorldTerrestrialEcosystems()])

# Resolve the geometry to environmental descriptions
response = resolver.get_environment(
    geometry,
    identifier="5b4edec5-ea5e-471a-8a3c-2c1171d59dee",
    description="Point on land",
)

```

The response is a GeoJSON feature containing a list of environments and their associated properties. These properties map to semantic resources, ENVO by default.

```json

          {

            "uri": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000892"
          },

            "uri": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000080"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


```


Format the response as Schema.org.

```python
schema_org = response.to_schema_org()
```
